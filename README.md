## how-to-use-this-repository

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.11 (if you don't want to use cuda, just use lastest version)
- OpenCV 4.10
- CUDA 11.8 (if you don't want to use cuda, just ignore it)
- cuDNN 8.8 (if you don't want to use cuda, just ignore it)

### Prepare the Environment:
opencvï¼š
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless
```bash

yolov5:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt```

- NumPy, Pandas, and other standard libraries



Ensure OpenCV, TensorFlow, and other required libraries are installed.

Place datasets (data, dataV2) in the correct directory structure as shown in the project.

and place the dataset in 'dataV2' folder

## file-descriptions

PersonDetectionOriginal.py

This script uses the original dataset to train a person detection model with two classes: person and person-like.
Performance was poor regardless of parameter tuning, as the dataset lacked images with no-person scenarios.

VideoPersonDetection.py

This script captures frames from the webcam and detects people in the images.
Initially used the PersonDetectionOriginal.py model but demonstrated poor performance. The script has since evolved to test better models.

VOCtoYOLO.py

Converts annotation files from the Pascal VOC format to the YOLO format.
Essential for preparing datasets for YOLO-based training.
Look at How to Use This Repository to get yolo first.

PedestrianDetectionYolo.py

Trains the YOLO pre-trained model using the data dataset for pedestrian detection. YOLO performance is way better than our model.
It can even draw around person, but it's still a pre-trained model. We planed to train our own.

RGBImageGenerator.py

Generates RGB block images with visually similar color patterns.
These RGB images were used to train a model (person2.h5) on the data dataset. However, the resulting model learned to classify based on visual patterns rather than actual person detection.

xmlGenerator.py

Automatically generates XML annotation files for no-person scenarios.

Txt_changer.py

Updates and manages text file lists (txt files) that correspond to image datasets in the 'data' folder.
Helps synchronize image datasets with corresponding text annotations.

PicGeneratorYolo.py

Identifies a critical flaw in the RGB-trained model (person2.h5), which misclassified based on image center color differences rather than actual human features.
Uses YOLO to blur or pixelate all human figures in the data dataset, labeling them as no-person. This augmented dataset was used to train a better model (person3.h5).

TrainModelV1.py

A training script specifically designed to train models on the data dataset.
Focuses on improving person detection performance within this dataset.

TrainModelV2.py

An improved training script designed for the dataV2 dataset, which includes a significantly larger collection of 35,000 images.
Aims to train higher-quality models with a more comprehensive dataset.

Face_Mark_Script.py

Detects and marks faces in the dataV2 dataset.
Automatically generates Pascal VOC XML annotations for all detected faces.

Models in the Repository
person.h5: The model trained using the original dataset with poor performance.
person2.h5: The model trained using RGB-generated images but failed to generalize due to pattern-based learning.
person3.h5: A refined model trained using an augmented dataset where human figures were pixelated, significantly improving performance.
Person_V2.h5: Model trained using the improved dataV2 dataset.
